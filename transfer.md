# File transfer over Gin

In Go, using the Gin web framework, you can send a file to the client by using the `Context.File()` method, which sends the specified file as an HTTP response. Below is an example of how you might set up a Gin HTTP server with an endpoint to send a file:

```go
package main
import (
	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
	"net/http"
)
func main() {
	// Initialize the Gin router
	router := gin.Default()
	// Define a route that sends a file when accessed
	router.GET("/file", func(c *gin.Context) {
		// Specify the file path
		filePath := "path/to/your/file.txt"
		// Check if the file exists and if it is not a directory before sending
		if _, err := os.Stat(filePath); err == nil {
			c.File(filePath)
		} else {
			// If there's an error (like file not found), return an HTTP 404 status
			c.AbortWithStatus(http.StatusNotFound)
		}
	})
	// Run the server on port 8080
	router.Run(":8080")
}
```

In this example, when a client sends a GET request to `http://localhost:8080/file`, the server will respond by sending the file located at `path/to/your/file.txt`. If the file does not exist, the server will respond with a 404 Not Found status.
Make sure to replace `path/to/your/file.txt` with the actual path to the file you want to serve.
To run this code, you need to have the Gin package installed.
