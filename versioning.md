# Versioning in Go

In Go, handling file versions typically involves implementing a system to manage different versions of a file, often by saving each version with a unique identifier, such as a timestamp or version number. Here's a basic approach to creating a file versioning system in Go:

1. **Define a Naming Convention**: Decide on a naming convention for your file versions. For example, you might append a timestamp or an incremental version number to the file's name.
2. **Save New Versions**: When saving a new version of a file, use the naming convention to create a new file rather than overwriting the existing one.
3. **List Versions**: Implement a function to list all versions of a file.
4. **Retrieve a Specific Version**: Implement a function to retrieve a specific version of a file based on its unique identifier.
   Here's an example of how you might implement a simple file versioning system in Go:

```go
package main
import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
	"time"
)
// saveVersion saves a new version of the file with the current timestamp.
func saveVersion(filePath string, data []byte) error {
	dir := filepath.Dir(filePath)
	base := filepath.Base(filePath)
	ext := filepath.Ext(filePath)
	name := base[0 : len(base)-len(ext)]
	version := time.Now().Format("20060102T150405") // YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS format
	newFileName := fmt.Sprintf("%s_%s%s", name, version, ext)
	newFilePath := filepath.Join(dir, newFileName)
	return ioutil.WriteFile(newFilePath, data, 0644)
}
// listVersions lists all versions of a file in the directory.
func listVersions(filePath string) ([]string, error) {
	dir := filepath.Dir(filePath)
	base := filepath.Base(filePath)
	ext := filepath.Ext(filePath)
	name := base[0 : len(base)-len(ext)]
	pattern := fmt.Sprintf("%s_*%s", name, ext)
	files, err := filepath.Glob(filepath.Join(dir, pattern))
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	return files, nil
}
func main() {
	// Example usage
	filePath := "example.txt"
	data := []byte("This is some file content.")
	// Save a new version of the file
	if err := saveVersion(filePath, data); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error saving version:", err)
		return
	}
	// List all versions of the file
	versions, err := listVersions(filePath)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error listing versions:", err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Println("Versions of the file:")
	for _, v := range versions {
		fmt.Println(v)
	}
}
```

In this example, the `saveVersion` function saves a new version of the file with a timestamp appended to the file name. The `listVersions` function lists all versions of the file based on the naming pattern.
This is a basic example, and a real-world application might require more features, such as version deletion, rollback, metadata storage, and more sophisticated error handling. You might also want to consider using a database to track file versions and metadata if your application requires complex versioning capabilities.
